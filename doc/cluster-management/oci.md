# OCI Cluster API Provider

Clusters are deployed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using the OCI
Cluster API Provider.  Cluster API is an API implemented as Kubernetes custom
resources that are serviced by applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.

Cluster API has a large interface.  Please refer to the [community documentation](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
for a complete description of the configuration options that are available.


## Terminology

The controllers that implement Cluster API run inside a Kubernetes cluster.
These clusters are known as "management clusters".  Management clusters control
the lifecycles of other clusters, known as "workload clusters".  A workload
cluster can be its own management cluster.

Using Cluster API always requires that a Kubernetes cluster is available.  If
a cluster is not available, the Oracle Cloud Native Environment CLI will create
one using the [libvirt](libvirt.md) provider.  It is referred to as a 
"boostrap cluster" or an "ephemeral cluster" depending on the context.

## Configuration

Creating a cluster in OCI using Cluster API requires credentials to an existing
OCI tenancy.  The privileges that are required depend on the configuration of
the cluster that is created.  For some types of deployments, it may be enough
to be able to create and destroy compute instances.  For other deployments, more
privilege is required.

A valid OCI configuration file is required.  Here is an example

```
$ cat ~/.oci/config
[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
fingerprint=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
region=us-ashburn-1
key_file=/home/myuser/.oci/key.pem
```
Clusters are deployed into specific compartments.  The OCI provider requires
that a comparment is available.  The compartment can be specified in the
configuration defaults or in the configuration for a specific cluster.
Compartments can be specified either by the OCID or by its path in the
compartment hierarchy (e.g. "parentcompartment/mycompartment".

```
$ cat ~/.ocne/defaults.yaml
providers:
  oci:
    compartment: parentcompartment/mycompartment
```

## Creating a Cluster API Cluster

A default cluster can be installed by specifying the "oci" provider with no
additional arguments.  The CLI will detect if a bootstrap cluster is available.
If not, it will start an ephemeral cluster to act as a bootstrap cluster.  Any
resources required to start the ephemeral cluster are fetched and installed.
Once the bootstrap cluster is available, the configured compartment is checked
for compatible compute images.  If there are no images available, they will be
uploaded and imported.  Once this process is complete, all Cluster API providers
are installed into the bootstrap cluster.  When they are started, the Cluster
API resources are installed into the bootstrap cluster.

## Generating a Cluster Template

The provider defaults result in a useful cluster, but in most cases additional
configuration is required.  To customize the deployment, generate a template to
use as a basis for the cluster.

The template command is responsive to the cluster configuration and local
defaults.  It also fetches things like compute image OCIDs from the configured
compartment automatically.

```
$ ocne cluster template
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  labels:
    cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name: "ocne"
  name: "ocne"
  namespace: "ocne"
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
    pods:
…
kind: OCIMachineTemplate

      shape: "VM.Standard.E4.Flex"
      shapeConfig:
        ocpus: "4"
```

## Using a Configuration File to Generate a Template and Start a Cluster

A configuration file can be used to populated template values as well as start
a cluster.

```
$ cat capi.yaml
provider: oci
name: ocne
workerNodes: 2
clusterDefinition: mycluster.oci
providers:
  oci:
    compartment: myparent/mycompartment

$ ocne cluster template -c capi.yaml > mycluster.oci
$ ocne cluster start -c capi.yaml
...
```

## Managing Cluster API Clusters

Once a cluster has been deployed, it is managed using the Cluster API resources
in the management cluster.  Please refer to the community documentation for
details.

## Self-Managed Clusters

A workload cluster can be its own management cluster.  This is known as a
"self-managed" cluster.  Once the cluster has been deployed by a boostrap
cluster, the API resources are migrated from the bootstrap cluster into the
new cluster.

Fully deleting a self-managed cluster requires that a second cluster is
available to run the controllers.  This is because the final stages of cluster
destruction will terminate any remaining compute instances and by extension
cluster nodes.  When this is complete, there will be no compute instances
available to run the controllers.  If a second cluster is not available, an
ephemeral cluster is created to service this need.
