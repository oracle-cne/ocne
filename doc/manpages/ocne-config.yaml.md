ocne-config.yaml - Cluster configuration for Oracle Cloud Native Environment

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This file contains the configuration for a Kubernetes cluster deployed by the
Oracle Cloud Native Environment.  A configuration file is meant to be used as
a template to recreate Kubernetes clusters in various environments without having
to maintain and synchronize multiple identical files for each cluster.

SCHEMA
------

```
# The name of the cluster
name: ocne

# The number of control plane nodes to spawn
# When the provider is set to oci, the number of control plane nodes must be odd
controlPlaneNodes: 1

# The number of worker nodes to spawn
workerNodes: 0

# When using the built-in keepalived/nginx load balancer
# the cluster is configured to use this IP.  In "libvirt" provider,
# if neither loadBalancer nor virtualIp is provided,
# a virtual IP is generated from the subnet of the control plane nodes.
virtualIp: 192.168.0.100

# The hostname or IP address of the external load balancer
# for the Kubernetes API server.  Do not use it if the virtualIp
# option is used.
loadBalancer: 100.100.1.1

# The provider used to deploy the cluster.  Valid values are "libvirt"
# and "VirtualBox".
provider: libvirt

# Any proxy parameters that need to be propagated into the cluster nodes.
# These values are set for any on-host services that require a network
# connection.
proxy:
  httpsProxy: http://myproxy:2138
  httpProxy: http://myproxy:2138
  noProxy: somehost.localdomain

# The Container Networking Interface (CNI) provider to install when the cluster
# is instantiated.  The value can be any CNI offered with Oracle Cloud Native
# Environment, or "none" if another CNI will be deployed either manually or via
# an application catalog.
#
# Note: Multus cannot be used as a primary CNI.
cni: flannel

# The subnet to use for the service network.
serviceSubnet: 10.96.0.0/12

# The mode for kube-proxy.  Can be one of either "iptables" or "ipvs"
kubeProxyMode: iptables

# The subnet to use for the pod network.  The chosen CNI is automatically
# configured to use this subnet.
podSubnet: 10.244.0.0/16

# Determines if the Oracle Cloud Native UI is installed.  If the value is set
# to true, then the UI is installed.  If if the value is false, then it will
# not.  The default value is "true".
headless: false

# Determines of "ocne cluster start" automatically opens a tunnel to
# the UI service and opens a browser with the UI.
autoStartUI: true

# Reduces the number of messages printed by "ocne"
quiet: false

# All cluster nodes are provisioned with this container image
# registry as the default registry to search for partially
# qualified container images.
registry: container-registry.oracle.com

# Specifies the port that the Kubernetes API is exposed on
kubeApiServerBindPort: 6443

# Specifies the port that kube-apiserver is actually listening on
# when deploying with the keepalived/nginx based self-hosted
# load balancer.
kubeApiServerBindPortAlt: 6444

# For clusters that use complex configuration that is not
# provided by this configuration file, this is the path
# to the file with the extra configuration.
# Note: This field is not applicable to libvirt and byo providers.
clusterDefinition: mycluster.yaml

# For clusters that use complex configuration that is not
# provided by the configuration file, this value can be
# used to specify in-line configuration.  This option
# cannot be used with "clusterDefinition".
# Note: This field is not applicable to libvirt and byo providers.
clusterDefinitionInline: |
  somekey: someval
  someotherkey: someotherval

# A list of catalogs to deploy to the target cluster after it has been
# instantiated.
catalogs:
  # The "name" field indicates the name of the catalog.  It is used
  # by other Oracle Cloud Native Environment interfaces to refer to
  # the catalog.
  #
  # The "uri" field indicates the source of the catalog.  Depending
  # on the source, a pod may or may not be deployed into the
  # cluster that serves the catalog content.
  - name: mycatalog
    uri: https://mycatalog.mydomain/catalog


# A list of modules to deploy to the target cluster after it has been
# instantiated.
applications:
  # The "application" field is the name of the application to install
  # from a catalog.
  #
  # The "name" field is the name of this deployment of the application.  It
  # is useful for applications that may benefit from having multiple
  # installations within a single cluster.
  #
  # The "catalog" field indicates which catalog contains the application.
  #
  # The "config" field contains a URI that points to a configuration file
  # for the application.
  - name: multus
    release: mymultus
    catalog: oracle
    config: git://gitlab.mydomain/configs/multus.yaml
